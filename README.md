### What is Run on Commit?
Run on Commit is a fast, compiled and minimal program that runs a script of your choice when there's a new commit to a GitHub public repository.

### Purpose
What motivated me to build this repository is the deployment and self-update of my website. I use this programm to self-update my docker containers that run instances of my web [portfolio](https://github.com/joaoofreitas/vue-portfolio).

But this program can have other purposes such has run your own scripts everytime there's a new commit in a repository.
